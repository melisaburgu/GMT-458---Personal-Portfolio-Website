ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage Notice
AI assistance was specifically used to create the 3D torus background animations in the "About Me" section of this project.
 * Learned Topic: With the help of AI, I learned how to create and integrate interactive 3D graphics into a web page using a library like Three.js.

All other parts of the website, including content, design, and coding, were completed independently by me.
